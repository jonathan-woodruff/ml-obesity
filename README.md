# ML Obesity

ML Obesity is a web app made using Flask.

It applies a SVC machine learning (ML) model to predict a person's obesity level based on their survey/form responses.

I built this project to showcase my ML skills to prospective employers. Check out my [portfolio site](https://jonathan-woodruff.github.io) to see all my skills.
